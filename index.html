   <p> <strong> Lorem Ipsum </strong> is simply dummy <u> text </u> of the printing and typesetting industry.  </p>
   <p> <strong> <i> Lorem Ipsum </i> </strong> <i> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark> 1500s, </mark> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </i>  </p>
   <p> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark> 1960s </mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing <br>
       Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <strong> <s> Aldus PageMaker </s> including versions of Lorem Ipsum  </strong> </p>
